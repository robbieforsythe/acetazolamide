title={Hemorrhagic Anuria With Acute Kidney Injury After a Single Dose of Acetazolamide: A Case Study of a Rare Side Effect.},
volume={12},
DOI={10.7759/cureus.10107},
abstractNote={Acetazolamide (ACZ) is a relatively commonly used medication in critical illness, glaucoma and altitude sickness. ACZ is sometimes used in the intensive care unit to assist with the treatment of metabolic alkalosis in ventilated patients. This is a case report of a patient who received two doses of ACZ, one week apart, for metabolic alkalosis and subsequently developed renal colic and dysuria that progressed to hemorrhagic anuria and acute kidney injury. This is an incredibly rare side effect of ACZ therapy, and has been reported in a few case reports in the literature, but usually is associated with a longer duration of therapy. This case resolved entirely within 24 hours with aggressive fluid therapy. Clinicians using ACZ therapy for any reason should be aware of this rare but significant side effect.

abstractNote={A patient with ocular hypertension was treated with acetazolamide. Acute renal failure developed rapidly and renal biopsy showed mild tubular lesions and crystal formation in a tubular lumen. By immunofluorescence studies with a monoclonal antibody, Tamm-Horsfall protein, normally absent from the proximal segments of the nephron, was detected in most glomeruli. This strongly suggests that tubular obstruction plays a major part in some cases of acetazolamide-induced acute renal failure.},

abstract = {Acetazolamide (ACZ) is a sulfonamide derivative that inhibits carbonic anhydrase and is the mainstay for prevention and treatment of acute mountain sickness (AMS). Acute kidney injury (AKI) is not well recognized as a complication of ACZ ingestion, especially when low doses are used for short periods of time. We report a case of a healthy, middle-aged man who developed severe AKI after the ingestion of ACZ for AMS prophylaxis. The patient presented with bilateral flank pain and anuric AKI without radiographic signs of obstructive uropathy. All blood and urine testing to determine the cause of AKI were negative or normal. The patient required 2 sessions of hemodialysis due to worsening metabolic derangements, which included severe anion gap metabolic acidosis and hyperphosphatemia. Renal function returned to baseline after 96 hours of supportive care. The pathogenesis of AKI in our patient was attributed to ACZ-induced sulfonamide crystalluria causing intratubular obstruction and retrograde urine flow, but not intraureteric precipitation or obstructive uropathy. This classic presentation of anuric AKI and renal colic has been previously described with higher doses of ACZ for prolonged periods of time but never with low doses for AMS prophylaxis such as in our patient (total dose of 1250 mg within 48 hours). Our case highlights the risk of adverse renal outcomes following ACZ ingestion, even in previously healthy individuals, and suggests that increased fluid intake may be advisable for travelers taking ACZ prophylaxis.},
