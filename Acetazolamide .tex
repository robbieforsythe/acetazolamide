\section*{Introduction}


		
\section*{Case Report}

This 7x year old lady attended the emergency department complaining of right sided loin pain for the past 24 hours. Blood tests on attendance demonstrated reduced renal function with a creatinine of \todo. Initially she was assessed with a plain CTKUB. This did not demonstrate any nephrolithiasis but did suggest some fullness of the collecting system. Given the CT findings she was further assessed with a renal tract ultrasound which excluded any hydronephrosis. 

It was noted that three days prior to admission she had had a repair of a macular hole performed at a private facility and had been commenced on acetazolamide 250mg twice daily. A review of the literature showed that similar presentations have been reported infrequently over many decades as a rare side effect of acetazolamide.
